# Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis and visualisation of weather data. It was created in the 2023/2024 summer semester by Hanna Szczerbi≈Ñska and [Martyna Sadowska](https://github.com/Martyna-265) as part of the Structured Data Processing course @ WUT. 

The first part of the project focused on analysing the accuracy of weather forecasts and how it correlates with various factors such as location or the predicted weather variable (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, cloud cover, etc).

In the second part, we dive deeper into analysing the data about air pollution.
