# Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis and visualisation of weather data, analysing the accuracy of weather forecasts and how it correlates with various factors such as location or the predicted weather variable (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, cloud cover, etc). It was created in the 2023/2024 summer semester by Hanna Szczerbi≈Ñska and Martyna Sadowska as part of the Structured Data Processing course @ WUT.
